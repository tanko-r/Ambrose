Git Push Instructions (one-time setup)
=======================================

1. Open your terminal (Git Bash or PowerShell)

2. cd to the repo:
   cd C:\Users\david\Documents\claude-redlining

3. Push main:
   git push origin main

   -> A browser window will open for GitHub login. Authenticate once.
   -> Credentials are saved after that (dpapi store).

4. Delete the old remote branch:
   git push origin --delete app-redesign-01-29-2026

5. Push the new feature branch:
   git checkout nextjs-migration
   git push -u origin nextjs-migration

Done. Future pushes should work without prompts.
