If Buyer disapproves of any such new or modified Exceptions (“New Title Objection”), Seller shall notify Buyer in writing within 5 Business Days after receipt of Buyer’s notice of New Title Objection whether or not Seller elects to remove the same.  If Seller elects to cure the New Title Objection, Seller shall be contractually obligated under this Agreement to remove such New Title Objection on or before Closing.  If Seller does not elect to cure the New Title Objection, then Buyer's sole options shall be either (a) to accept the disapproved New Title Objection as a Permitted Exception, or (b) by written notice to Seller within 5 Business Days of Seller's election of non-removal, to terminate this Agreement, in which case the Earnest Money Deposit shall be returned to Buyer within 2 Business Days after termination.  Buyer's failure to act within 5 Business Days of receipt of Seller's election not to remove a New Title Objection shall be deemed an election under clause (a) to accept the disapproved New Title Objection as a Permitted Exception. To the extent necessary, the Closing Date shall be extended to accommodate the time periods established in this Section 4.4.",

Seller shall deliver drafts of the estoppel certificates to Buyer in electronic format within 10 Business Days after the Effective Date.  Buyer shall be deemed to have approved the draft estoppel certificates unless it objects to specific errors or omissions within 10 Business Days after receipt thereof and provides updated drafts to Seller in electronic format.  Seller shall deliver the approved estoppel certificate to each Tenant.  Each Tenant shall be asked to execute and deliver the estoppel certificate within the time period permitted under its Lease, or if no time period is specified therein, within 10 days.  Within 2 Business Days after receipt of an executed estoppel certificate, Seller shall forward a copy of such estoppel certificate to Buyer.  Provided Seller has complied with the requirements above, Seller shall not be in default if any Tenant does not execute and deliver an estoppel certificate.  Receipt of Conforming Tenant Estoppels (as defined below) from the Major Tenants (plus a sufficient number of other Tenants under Leases so that Buyer receives Conforming Tenant Estoppels for Leases covering at least 80% of the currently leased square footage of the Improvements by no later than the Tenant Estoppel Deadline, shall be a condition precedent to Buyer’s obligation to purchase the Property hereunder.  If an estoppel certificate executed and returned by a Tenant discloses any material matter that is inconsistent with the Due Diligence Materials (including the Leases), or any representations and warranties made by Seller hereunder and Buyer objects to such inconsistent matter, Buyer shall notify Seller of such inconsistent matter within 5 Business Days after receipt of the estoppel and such estoppel shall be deemed a “Nonconforming Tenant Estoppel”.  Each executed tenant estoppel to which Buyer does not timely object shall be deemed a “Conforming Tenant Estoppel”.  Seller shall use good faith, diligent efforts to cause the inconsistent matters disclosed in the Nonconforming Tenant Estoppel to be corrected or deleted prior to Closing, and Seller may postpone Closing up to 14 days to allow Seller to attempt to accomplish such cure.  If Seller is unable to cure such matter prior to Closing, then Seller shall notify Buyer, and Buyer, as its sole remedy therefor, may elect to either: (i) postpone Closing one time for up to 14 days to allow Seller to attempt to accomplish such cure, (ii) terminate this Agreement, in which event the Earnest Money Deposit shall be returned to Buyer and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement (except under those provisions that expressly survive a termination of this Agreement), or (iii) close the transaction regardless of the inconsistent matter(s) disclosed in the Nonconforming Tenant Estoppel(s) (in which case they shall be treated as Conforming Tenant Estoppel(s)) without a reduction in the Purchase Price.  In the event Buyer elects to postpone Closing pursuant to option (i) above and Seller does not accomplish such cure prior to the extended Closing date, Buyer, as its sole remedy therefor, may then elect either option (ii) or option (iii) above.",

If Buyer elects to proceed with the purchase, Seller shall not be obligated to repair any damage or destruction and upon the Closing, there shall be a credit against the Purchase Price due hereunder equal to the amount of any uninsured loss, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards collected by Seller before Closing as a result of any such damage or destruction or condemnation, plus the amount of any insurance deductible not recoverable under the Leases, less any sums expended by Seller toward the restoration or repair of the Property, including barricades and other temporary repairs required for safety purposes, or in collecting such insurance proceeds or condemnation awards.  If the proceeds or awards have not been collected as of the Closing, then such proceeds or awards shall be assigned to Buyer, except to the extent needed to reimburse Seller for sums expended prior to the Closing to repair or restore the Property, including barricades and other temporary repairs required for safety purposes, or to collect any such proceeds or awards.",
